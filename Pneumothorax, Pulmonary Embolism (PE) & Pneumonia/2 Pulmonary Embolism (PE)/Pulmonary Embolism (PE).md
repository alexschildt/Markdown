# Definition
* An occlusion of a portion of the pulmonary vascular bed by an embolus
* Thrombus (blood clot) - most common
* Tissue fragments
* Lipids
* Air bubble

# Etiologies
* VIRCHOWS Triad
* Venous stasis-slowing or stagnation
* Hypercoagulabilty - increased tendency to form clots
* Vascular wall damage

# Pathogenesis Massive Pulmonary Embolism

# Clinical Symptoms
* Variable - non specific
* HX - risk factors
* Most common - PE with infarction Tachycardia, tachypnea, dyspnea ,anxiety
* DVT - Homanâ€™s sign
* Fat emboli - marked mental status changes, fevers, marked dyspnea

# Diagnostics
* Perfusion scan/angiogram
* Spiral CT scan
* Blood tests

# Treatment
* Prevent risk factors
* Avoid venous stasis
* Clot prevention
* Anticoagulation
* Thrombolytic agents
* Surgery-pulmonary embolectomy, filter, Vein ligation

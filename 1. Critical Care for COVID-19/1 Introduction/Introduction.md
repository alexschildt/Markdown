# Symptoms of COVID-19 patients

The spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity:

- *Mild* (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.
- *Severe* (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.
- *Critical* (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.


# Caring for critical COVID-19 patients

The first session will focus on caring for patients affected by COVID-19.

To date, **the most serious reported symptoms from COVID-19 are pulmonary complications.** This video lecture quickly provides learners with the knowledge and resources to provide essential care to ICU patients with coronavirus.

Topics addressed in the session:
- [ ] ABG Analysis, Oxygen Delivery, Airway Management, and Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation - ICU
- [ ] Assessing and Managing Respiratory Failure and ARDS - ICU
- [ ] Invasive Mechanical Ventilation: Priorities for Endotracheal Intubation, Tracheostomy Care, Ventilator Settings and Troubleshooting - ICU
- [ ] Spontaneous Awakening and Breathing Trials, Neuromuscular Blockade, Ventilator Weaning, Extubation Priorities, and Preventing Complications From Mechanical Ventilation - ICU

You will need to create an account on AACN or use an existing account to login. After that, take the **COVID-19 Pulmonary Resources** course.

# Diagnosis and Management of Shock

Septic shock and specific organ dysfunction such as acute kidney injury appear to occur in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19â€“related critical illness and are associated with increasing mortality, with management recommendations following available evidence-based guidelines.

In the care of COVID-19 patients, it is important to be able to **respond promptly to a patient in shock**.

The goals of this session are:
- [ ] Review the primary categories of shock
- [ ] Discuss goals of resuscitation in shock
- [ ] Summarize principles of shock management
- [ ] Describe effects of vasopressor and intropic agents
- [ ] Discuss the different diagnosis and management of oliguria

# Final review session - Theory recap and assessment

In this section, you will go through a summary of what you have learnt in the course, followed by an assessment-based review session.

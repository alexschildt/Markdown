# Critical Care Handbook for COVID-19

Prior to beginning on a critical care unit, review the handbook for critical care management as a self-study tool. You may also use this handbook as a reference to review with your preceptor when you arrive on the unit.

Please note, this document will be updated on an ongoing basis as guidance evolves.

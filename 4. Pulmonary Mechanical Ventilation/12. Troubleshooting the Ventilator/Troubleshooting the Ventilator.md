# Introductory Note
Guard against incorrect ventilator settings.
Ventilator disconnect from patient is a common problem.

# High pressure alarm
* Patient needs suctioning
* Patient is biting the tube
* Tracheal tube has become misplaced
* Compliance is decreased
* Barotrauma

# Not receiving set tidal volume
* Cuff leak/insufficient air in cuff
 * ALARM: low volume air
 * RX: Ventilate patient until cause is identified
* Airway resistance. Compliance
 * ALARM: upper airway pressure alarm**
 * RX: Ventilate patient until cause is identified**

# NO tidal volume
* Patient disconnect from ventilator
* Large cuff leak
* Tube disconnect
* ALARM: low volume alarm
* RX: Reconnect tubing, attempt to ambu until reintubation

# Increased Airway Pressure
* Secretions, mucous plug, biting on the tube
* Decreased compliance – pneumothorax, atelectasis
* ETT slipped into RIGHT mainstem bronchus
* Increased resistance – high diaphragm
* ALARM: airway pressure alarm
* RX: Suctioning, bite plate
 * Assess breath sounds for ET placement
 * Position patient
 * Sedation

# Decreased or Loss of Volume
* Leak in ventilator system
* Cuff leak
* Humidifier leak
* RX: Correct leak source

# Respiratory Alkalosis
* CO2<35 pH >7.45
* Increased respiratory rate
* Restlessness, pain, anxiety
* Rate set up too high
* Tidal volume set too high
* RX: Sedation
 * Adjust rate, tidal volume

# Question 1
What ventilator settings may cause respiratory alkalosis?

[RIGHT] Rate and tidal volume set too high
[WRONG] Rate and tidal volume set too low

# Respiratory Acidosis
* CO2>45 pH <7.35
* RX: Increase tidal volume
 * Adjust rate, tidal volume

# Question 2
In the event of respiratory acidosis, what should you do?

[RIGHT] Increase tidal volume and adjust the rate 
[WRONG] Decrease tidal volume and adjust the rate

# Thick Secretions
* Inadequate hydration
* Insufficient humidification
* Infection, fever
* RX: Water in humidifier
 * Monitor fluid status

# High PaO2
* Delivering too high FiO2
* Improved clinical status

# Low PaO2
* VQ mismatch
* Pulmonary embolus
* Pulmonary edema
* RX: Monitor ABG and adjust FiO2 accordingly
 * PEEP

# Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased venous return
* Relief of work effort
* PEEP
* Inadequate fluid volume status

Always assess patient first, then check the ventilator tubing while ambuing.

# Alarms

### Common Alarms

#### ↑Ppeak–High peak pressure
Most common causes are: coughing, thick secretions, mucous plug, kinks in the circuit

#### ↓Ppeak–Low peak pressure
* Leak (either in the circuit or the airway cuff)
* Will most likely also be associated with ↓ Vte and ↓ Ve
* Vt does not meat patients demand

#### ↑Vte – High expired tidal volume
Most common cause is a nebulizer is being run inline which the vent reads as additional tidal volume.

#### ↓Vte
Most common causes are either a leak in the circuit or airway cuff or Ventilator-Patient Desynchrony

#### ↑Ve – High minute ventilation
Most commonly due to tachypnea or secondary to ↑Vte due to nebulizer running inline

#### ↓Ve – Low minute volume
Leaks

#### Circuit Disconnect - Patient may have become disconnected from the vent.
This will also occur with patient-ventilator dyssynchrony(patient vent demands are not met)


### High-Priority Alarms

* These alarms must not be ignored, patient safety is at risk! If any of these alarms occur assess your
patient (if vital signs are stable then attempt to rectify, if not then manually ventilate and call RCS)
* Patient Disconnect
* Severe Occlusion
* These alarms cannot be reset until rectified

### Low and Medium Priority (! And !!)

* These alarms are indicators of a change in a patients ventilation status and should be addressed.
    * Coughing
    * Secretions
    * Water in the tube

[WRONG] Patient needs suctioning
[WRONG] Patient biting the tube
[RIGHT] Tube disconnect

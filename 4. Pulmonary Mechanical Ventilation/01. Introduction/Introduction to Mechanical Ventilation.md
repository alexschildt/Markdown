# Course Structure

Welcome to Pulmonary Mechanical Ventilation! The course will be instructor-led and follow the structure below.

We strongly advise moving forward with the course only after completing the instructor-led session. The next steps you will be able to take after that are watching 2 videos summarizing Mechanical Ventilation concepts and presenting case studies, and completing the associated multiple-choice questions.

1. Oxygenation and Ventilation
2. Respiratory Decompensation 3. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) 4. Supplemental Oxygen Delivery System & Treatments: Non-aerosolized & Aerosolized Oxygen Delivery Systems 5. Nebulizers 6. Pulmonary ABG
7. ICU Device use 8. Types of Ventilators 9. Routes & Modes of Mechanical Ventilation 10. ETT & Intubation 11. Identifying Ventilator Needs 12. Troubleshooting the Ventilator 13. Complications 14. Issues in Nursing Management 15. Nursing Interventions 16. Mechanical Ventilation Weaning 17. Capnography 18. Collecting COVID-19 Specimens for Testing

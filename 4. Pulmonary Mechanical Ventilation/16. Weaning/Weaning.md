# Important Information Needed
* Adequacy of PaO2, pH, PaCO
* FIO2 - .4 to .5
* Very low or no PEEP
* Reasonable spontaneous respiratory rate

# Parameters
* Vital capacity greater than 10 ml/kg
* Tidal volume greater than 5ml/kg
* Maximum inspiratory force (-20 ml H2O)

# Steps & Methodology

### Steps
* Describe process to the patient – relax
* Vital signs stable
* Hemodynamics stable
* Evaluate level of consciousness
* Correct anemia
* Adequate hydration

### Methodology
* T-piece
* SIMV
* Pressure support ventilation - CPAP

### Mechanics
* Vital capacity >10 to 15 cc/kg (usually 1000 cc)
* Tidal volume >5 cc/kg(usually 200cc)
* Minute ventilation <10L/min indicates a high ventilatory requirement has been reduced

#### Maximal voluntary ventilation: >twice the minute ventilation

#### Maximal inspiratory pressure > -20 ml H2O

#### Oxygenation
* PaO2: 60 to 70 mmHg (50-60 mmHg for COPD) with FIO2<0.40

#### Ventilation
* PaCO2: <45 mmHg or equal to the patient’s baseline PaCO2

# Failure Signs
* BP deviation of 20 mmHg or more
* HR deviation of 20 bpm or more
* Respiratory rate >35 breaths per minute
* Arrhythmias – new onset
* Change in LOC

# Question 1
Define ventilator weaning:

[WRONG] Turning off the ventilator and letting the patient breathe spontaneously
[WRONG] Changing to a noninvasive form of ventilation
[WRONG] Increasing the tidal volume delivered by the ventilator
[RIGHT] Decreasing the number of ventilator breaths while allowing an increased number of spontaneous breaths

# Question 2
When using T-piece trials to wean, which of the following is true?

[RIGHT] The patient alternates time on the ventilator with time breathing spontaneously
[WRONG] The number of ventilator breaths is gradually decreased
[WRONG] The patient has the benefit of the ventilator alarms while on the T-piece
[WRONG] The T-piece gives a postive pressure “boost” to decrease the work of breathing

# Question 3
What should a patient’s minimum spontaneous tidal volume be in order to be successfully weaned from the ventilator?

[WRONG] 10 ml/kg
[WRONG] 20 ml/kg
[RIGHT] 5ml/kg
[WRONG] 7-10 ml/kg

# Question 4
Which of the following is not a component of weaning criteria?

[WRONG] Negative inspiratory force
[RIGHT] I:E ratio
[WRONG] Minute volume
[WRONG] Vital capacity

# Question 5
What kind of oxygen administration system should be used for a patient immediately after extubation?

[WRONG] Nasal cannula
[WRONG] Venturi mask
[WRONG] Room air
[RIGHT] Humidified mask

# Question 6
Which of the following should be done to assess respiratory status after extubation?

[RIGHT] ABG
[WRONG] Electrolyte panel
[WRONG] Monitor end tidal CO2
[WRONG] Bronchoscopy

# Complications of Mechanical Ventilation

### Infection
* Normal filtering system (nose) is bypassed
* Breaks in aseptic technique
* Debilitated patients

### Airway Obstruction
* Inadequate humidification causing thickened mucus
* Increased secretions with inadequate pulmonary toiletry
* Patient biting tube

### Atelectasis
* Bedrest
* Inadequate tidal volume
* Absent intermittent deep lung infections

### Oxygen Toxicity
* Prolonged high oxygen levels – FiO2 0.7-1.0
* Impaired surfactant activity

### Gastrointestinal Bleeding
* Stress
* Gastric hypersecretion of acid
* Lack of antacid therapy

### Pneumothorax
* Positive pressure causing a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura

### Hypotension
* Normal negative pressure becomes positive – decreases venous return
* Decreased pulmonary blood flow due to increased intrathoracic pressure compressing capillaries
* Compression of heart between the lungs - decreasing stroke volume

### Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)
* Caused by over-stretching of the airways and alveoli.
* Areas of the lung that are collapsed (atelectasis) or filled with secretions will be underinflated, while those areas that are relatively normal will be overinflated.
* These areas will become overdistended and injured.
* Preventing alveolar overdistension
* Preventing cyclic atelectasis (atelectotrauma)

### Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD)
* Ventilatory muscle abnormalities induced by mechanical ventilatory strategies that suppress or eliminate spontaneous ventilatory muscle activity
* Patients perform little or no work to receive ventilatory support. Ventilatory muscles thus receive virtually no neural stimulation and have virtually no muscle loading.
* Prevent by adjusting level of unloading as fatigue recovery occurs

# Question 1
Which of the following can cause airway obstruction with mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Decreased secretions
[WRONG] Excessive humidification
[RIGHT] Patient biting the tube

# Question 2
When using mechanical ventilation, what can form when positive pressure causes a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura?

[WRONG] Pneumonia
[WRONG] Pulmonary embolism
[RIGHT] Pneumothorax

# Question 3
What can cause a patient to become hypotensive during mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Increased pulmonary blood flow
[WRONG] Normal positive pressure becomes negative and increases venous return
[RIGHT] Normal negative pressure becomes positive and decreases venous return

# Non-Invasive Positive Ventilation

Method of ventilation without intubation.

Tight fitting nasal, oro-nasal or face mask attached to a non-invasive pressure support ventilator (NIPSV or BIPAP) unit.

Unit programmed to set back-up
* Respiratory rate
* Inspiratory positive airway pressure(IPAP)
* Expiratory pressure (EPAP)
* Supplemental FiO2 to maintain O2 sat > 92%

# Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP)
* Delivers different pressure depending on wetherthe patient is taking a breath of exhaling.

# Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
* Increases Oxygenation Level
* Decreases breathing workload
* Increases intrathoracic pressure which will lower preload thereby lowering cardia workload

**Aerosolized Intervention: USE N95 when caring for**

**patients using either BiPAPor CPAP**

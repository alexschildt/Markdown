* You must use N95 when caring for patients on HFNC.
* Set flow 10-50L
* FiO2: 21-100%
* No Alarms
* #1 issue is cannula kinks
 *If FiO2 goes higher than
       originally set, there might be
       a kink on the cannula prongs


#### Benefits of HFNC

* Reduces
    * Respiratory rate
    * Carbon dioxide level
    * Breathing effort
* Increases
    * Tidal volume
* Improves
    * Mucus clearance
    * Oxygenation

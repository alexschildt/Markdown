# Modes of Ventilation

### Control Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate

#### Disadvantages
* No spontaneous breathing
* Patient cannot adjust to changes in demands
* Lack of control – panic
* May lead to hyperventilation
* Requires sedation/paralysis

### A/C – Assist Control
* Each breath is either “Assisted” or “Controlled”
* Controlled breaths are determined by the rate or frequency (“f”) that is set.
* Assisted breaths that are triggered by the patient (spontaneous)
* Combines CMV with patient triggered mode
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate

#### Advantages
* Patient can adjust to changes in demand
* Patient sets own breath interval
* Resting of respiratory muscles

#### Disadvantages
* May decrease cardiac output
* Respiratory alkalosis

### Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
* Combines spontaneous breathing with mechanical ventilatory support
* Preset rate, tidal volume but allows spontaneous breaths at whatever tidal volume

#### Advantages
* Synchronized respirations – less stacking and air trapping
* Allows exercise of respiratory muscles
* Possible less resp alkalosis in anxious patient

### Disadvantages
* Limited capacity to meet increasing ventilatory demands
* Resp acidosis may occur if insufficient ventilation
* Fatigue of respiratory muscles can occur

### Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
* Pressure-assisted form of mechanical ventilation
* Augments patient’s own spontaneous efforts

#### Advantages
* Patient controls inspiratory timing
* Gas flow can be changed to increase comfort
* Work of breathing can be relieved or progressively allowed
* Used in weaning
* Support ventilation along with SIMV

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volumes can decrease – due to decrease compliance
* Not for full support of unstable patients
* Back-up rate is not guaranteed if used alone

### Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)
* Describes as pressure-control with inverse ratio ventilation
* Mechanical inspiratory phase limited to prevent lung trauma
* Inspiratory phase is longer than expiratory phase providing an I:E ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 (instead of normal I:E ratio of 1:2)

#### Advantage
* Improved arterial oxygenation and ventilation with lower peak pressure

#### Disadvantages
* Limited use – requires technical support and experience
* Requires sedation and neuromuscular paralysis

# Adjuncts to Mechanical Ventilation

### Positive-End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
* Airway pressure is maintained at end of expiration
* Increases functional residual capacity (FRC) thus improving lung volume and promoting alveolar recruitment
* Used for patients with refractory hypoxemia and bilateral lung disease

#### Complications
* Reduced cardiac output
* May increase intracerebral pressure
* Increase risk for barotrauma
* Increase risk for pneumothorax

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
* Patient breathes independently, either through the ventilator circuit or with CPAP mask
* No preset tidal volume
* FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation are controlled
* Used most often with patients requiring intubation for airway management
* Also used as weaning mode
* Commonly used as treatment for sleep apnea

PEEP is used when the patient is receiving a mechanical breath.
CPAP is used when the patient is breathing spontaneously.

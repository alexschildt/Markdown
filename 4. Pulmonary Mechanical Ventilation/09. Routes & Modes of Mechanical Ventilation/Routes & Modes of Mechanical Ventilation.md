# Question 1
Which of the following is an urgent route for mechanical ventilation?

[RIGHT] Cricoidotomy
[WRONG] Endotracheal
[WRONG] Nasotracheal
[WRONG] Tracheal-Tracheostomy

# Modes of Ventilation

### Control Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate

#### Disadvantages
* No spontaneous breathing
* Patient cannot adjust to changes in demands
* Lack of control – panic
* May lead to hyperventilation
* Requires sedation/paralysis

### A/C – Assist Control
* Each breath is either “Assisted” or “Controlled”
* Controlled breaths are determined by the rate or frequency (“f”) that is set.
* Assisted breaths that are triggered by the patient (spontaneous)
* Combines CMV with patient triggered mode
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate

#### Advantages
* Patient can adjust to changes in demand
* Patient sets own breath interval
* Resting of respiratory muscles

#### Disadvantages
* May decrease cardiac output
* Respiratory alkalosis

### Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
* Combines spontaneous breathing with mechanical ventilatory support
* Preset rate, tidal volume but allows spontaneous breaths at whatever tidal volume

#### Advantages
* Synchronized respirations – less stacking and air trapping
* Allows exercise of respiratory muscles
* Possible less resp alkalosis in anxious patient

### Disadvantages
* Limited capacity to meet increasing ventilatory demands
* Resp acidosis may occur if insufficient ventilation
* Fatigue of respiratory muscles can occur

### Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
* Pressure-assisted form of mechanical ventilation
* Augments patient’s own spontaneous efforts

#### Advantages
* Patient controls inspiratory timing
* Gas flow can be changed to increase comfort
* Work of breathing can be relieved or progressively allowed
* Used in weaning
* Support ventilation along with SIMV

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volumes can decrease – due to decrease compliance
* Not for full support of unstable patients
* Back-up rate is not guaranteed if used alone

### Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)
* Describes as pressure-control with inverse ratio ventilation
* Mechanical inspiratory phase limited to prevent lung trauma
* Inspiratory phase is longer than expiratory phase providing an I:E ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 (instead of normal I:E ratio of 1:2)

#### Advantage
* Improved arterial oxygenation and ventilation with lower peak pressure

#### Disadvantages
* Limited use – requires technical support and experience
* Requires sedation and neuromuscular paralysis

# Question 2
What characterizes Control Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)? 

[RIGHT] Preset tidal volume and preset respiratory rate
[WRONG] Preset tidal volume but not respiratory rate
[WRONG] Preset respiratory rate but not tidal volume
[WRONG] No preset respiratory rate and no preset tidal volume

# Question 3
What characterizes Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)? 

[RIGHT] Preset rate and tidal volume, but allows spontaneous breaths at any tidal volume
[WRONG] Preset tidal volume, but allows spontaneous breaths at any rate
[WRONG] Preset rate but not preset tidal volume
[WRONG] Preset tidal volume but not preset rate
[WRONG] No preset rate or tidal volume

# Question 4
What are the key advantages of Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)?

[RIGHT] Patient control of inspiratory timing, easy change of gas flow
[WRONG] Tidal volumes can decrease


# Adjuncts to Mechanical Ventilation

### Positive-End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
* Airway pressure is maintained at end of expiration
* Increases functional residual capacity (FRC) thus improving lung volume and promoting alveolar recruitment
* Used for patients with refractory hypoxemia and bilateral lung disease

#### Complications
* Reduced cardiac output
* May increase intracerebral pressure
* Increase risk for barotrauma
* Increase risk for pneumothorax

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
* Patient breathes independently, either through the ventilator circuit or with CPAP mask
* No preset tidal volume
* FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation are controlled
* Used most often with patients requiring intubation for airway management
* Also used as weaning mode
* Commonly used as treatment for sleep apnea

PEEP is used when the patient is receiving a mechanical breath.
CPAP is used when the patient is breathing spontaneously.

# Question 5
What characterizes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)?

[RIGHT] Patient breathes independently, potentially through a ventilator circuit
[WRONG] Preset tidal volume, controlled FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation
[WRONG] No preset tidal volume, no control of FiO2 and gas pressure at end-exhalation

# Question 6
Which mechanical ventilation approach is most suitable when a patient is breathing spontaneously?

[RIGHT] CPAP
[WRONG] PEEP

# Ventilation Settings 

* f – Frequency or Rate (breaths/minute)
* Vt – Tidal Volume (amount of air/gas that is inhaled per breath)
* FiO2 – Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, is the percentage of oxygen that is being delivered
* PEEP – Positive End Expiratory Pressure, amount of positive pressure applied at the end  expiration

# Measured Values
* PIP – Peak Inspiratory Pressure
* PEEP – Positive End Expiratory Pressure (Measured)
* I:E – Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio (this is a ratio and not a measurement of time i.e. seconds)
* F(tot) – Total respiratory rate, mechanical and spontaneous
* Vt(e) – Measurement of Exhaled tidal volume
* Ve(tot) – Total Minute Volume (Ftot X Vte)

# Procedural Buttons

* 100% FiO2 – Increases FiO2 to 100% for two minutes
    * Used prior to suctioning the patient
* Inspiratory Pause – breath hold at the peak of inspiration
    * Used to determine Plateau Pressure as well as Static and Dynamic Compliance
* Expiratory Pause – breath hold at the end of expiration
    *Used to determine Intrinsic PEEP or AutoPEEP

# Alarms

### Common Alarms

#### ↑Ppeak–High peak pressure
Most common causes are: coughing, thick secretions, mucous plug, kinks in the circuit

#### ↓Ppeak–Low peak pressure
* Leak (either in the circuit or the airway cuff)
* Will most likely also be associated with ↓ Vte and ↓ Ve
* Vt does not meat patients demand

#### ↑Vte – High expired tidal volume
Most common cause is a nebulizer is being run inline which the vent reads as additional tidal volume.

#### ↓Vte
Most common causes are either a leak in the circuit or airway cuff or Ventilator-Patient Desynchrony

#### ↑Ve – High minute ventilation
Most commonly due to tachypnea or secondary to ↑Vte due to nebulizer running inline

#### ↓Ve – Low minute volume
Leaks

#### Circuit Disconnect - Patient may have become disconnected from the vent.
This will also occur with patient-ventilator dyssynchrony(patient vent demands are not met)


### High-Priority Alarms

* These alarms must not be ignored, patient safety is at risk! If any of these alarms occur assess your
patient (if vital signs are stable then attempt to rectify, if not then manually ventilate and call RCS)
* Patient Disconnect
* Severe Occlusion
* These alarms cannot be reset until rectified

### Low and Medium Priority (! And !!)

* These alarms are indicators of a change in a patients ventilation status and should be addressed.
    * Coughing
    * Secretions
    * Water in the tube

# Indications

### Inability to maintain adequate ventilation

* Ventilation – ability to remove CO2 from lungs
* High PaCO2 – hypoventilation
* Low PaCO2 - hyperventilation

### Inability to maintain adequated oxygenation

* Hypercarbia and hypoxemia frequently occur together
* Hypoxemia with low to normal CO2
* PaO2 cannot be maintained >50 mmHg by increasing FiO2

### Work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

* Ventilation is inefficient and exhausting
* Increased RR due to stiff compliance
* Decreased vital capacity

Isolate and protect the airway.

Relieve airway obstruction.

Facilitate suctioning of the tracheobronchial tree.

# Question 1
What is hypoventilation? 
[RIGHT] High PaCO2 
[WRONG] Low PaCO2 

# Question 2
What is hyperventilation? 
[RIGHT] Low PaCO2
[WRONG] High PaCO2

# Question 3
What indicates that the work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain?
[RIGHT] Ventilation is exhausting, increased respiration rate due to stiff compliance, decreased vital capacity
[WRONG] Ventilation is exhausting, decreased respiration rate, increased vital capacity

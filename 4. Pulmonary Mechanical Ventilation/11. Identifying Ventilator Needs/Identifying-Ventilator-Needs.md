# Indications

### Inability to maintain adequate ventilation

* Ventilation – ability to remove CO2 from lungs
* High PaCO2 – hypoventilation
* Low PaCO2 - hyperventilation

### Inability to maintain adequated oxygenation

* Hypercarbia and hypoxemia frequently occur together
* Hypoxemia with low to normal CO2
* PaO2 cannot be maintained >50 mmHg by increasing FiO2

### Work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

* Ventilation is inefficient and exhausting
* Increased RR due to stiff compliance
* Decreased vital capacity

Isolate and protect the airway.

Relieve airway obstruction.

Facilitate suctioning of the tracheobronchial tree.

# Question 1
What is hypoventilation? 

[RIGHT] High PaCO2 
[WRONG] Low PaCO2 

# Question 2
What is hyperventilation? 

[RIGHT] Low PaCO2
[WRONG] High PaCO2

# Question 3
What indicates that the work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain?

[RIGHT] Ventilation is exhausting, increased respiration rate due to stiff compliance, decreased vital capacity
[WRONG] Ventilation is exhausting, decreased respiration rate, increased vital capacity

# Question 4
Which of the following is an indication of mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Provide fluids to the lungs
[WRONG] Remove pericardial fluid
[RIGHT] Isolate and protect the airway

# Question 5
What does decreased vital capacity indicate?

[WRONG] The patient has decreased cardiac output
[WRONG] The patient has adequate breathing ability
[RIGHT] The work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

# Question 6
Which of the following is not an indication for mechanical ventilation?

[RIGHT] Myocardial infarction (MI)
[WRONG] Respiratory failure
[WRONG] Provide stability of the chest wall after trauma or surgery
[WRONG] Brain injury requiring a barbituate-induced coma

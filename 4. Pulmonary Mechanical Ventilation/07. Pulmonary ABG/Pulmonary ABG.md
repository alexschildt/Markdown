# Correction vs. Compensation

### Correction

* Primary disorder is repaired. All acid base parameters return to normal.

### Compensation

* Primary disorder continues, opposite system begins to adjust
* Attempts to restore ratio of 1 part acid to 20 parts base
* Can be partial or complete compensation

# Steps to Acid Base Interpretation

### Analyze each acid base parameters. 

* pH, PaCO2, HCO3-: low, normal, high?

### Match acid base disturbance with parameter causing disturbance

* pH↓ and PaCO2↑ = Respiratory Acidosis
* pH↑ and PaCO2↓ = Respiratory Alkalosis
* pH↓ and HCO3-↓ = Metabolic Acidosis
* pH↑ and HCO3-↑ = Metabolic Alkalosis

### Look for Compensation

* All variables are abnormal
* Either the PaCO2 or the HCO3- abnormality would cause the acid base change
* The opposite system has changed in a manner that would have caused the opposite pH change
* Example 1: 
 * pH < 7.37
 * PaCO2↓
 * HCO3-↓
 * Disturbance: Metabolic Acidosis with Respiratory Compensation
* Example 2:
 * pH < 7.37
 * PaCO2↑
 * HCO3-↑
 * Disturbance: Metabolic Alkalosis with Respiratory Compensation


### Look for Combined Disorders

* All acid base parameters are abnormal
* Both the PaCO2 and HCO#- would have caused the pH to change in the manner that occurred

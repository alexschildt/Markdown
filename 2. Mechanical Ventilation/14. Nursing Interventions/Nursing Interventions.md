# Interventions Pt. 1 ---> all of this should be combined with prior modules related to nursing assessment... I'm not seeing anything new here?

I deleted this because it shows up elsewhere
 
* Prone position for selected patients --> this is the only new and important content that I think should be in this section

I deleted this because I added in oral care before-- and frequency of oral care will depend on facility (sometimes it's every 2 hours)

My idea for what could be included here:


# Prone Positioning
Patients with ARDS can benefit from prone positioning as this enhances V/Q matching. This is typically indicated for a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 100 and/or in patients who are not responding to other therapies. Perfusion shifts from the posterior portions of the lung (when the patient is supine) to the anterior, larger portions of the lungs (when the patient is prone). Prone positioning also enhances ventilation by removing the weight of the heart and abdomen on the lungs. 
Prone positioning is traditionally accomplished with a specialized bed that requires close monitoring by the RN and RT.

Considerations:
* Increased ocular pressure due to inadequate eyelid closure and dependent edema when prone: tape eyes closed, lubricate
* Skin breakdown in new anterior areas (eg. knees, shins, face, breasts, shoulders, iliac crests)
* In the case of a code, secure the patient, press the "CPR" button and the patient will be immediately placed supine, begin chest compressions
* Facial edema: consider cooling packs to patient face when supine if indicated
* Place IV extension tubing for all IV infusions to allow for rotation of the bed
* Possible gastric aspiration (often pause enteral feeds prior to turning)

# Question 1
What is the rationale for prone positioning?
[RIGHT] Enhances V/Q matching
[WRONG] It is an effective weaning mode
[WRONG] It reduces perfusion to lung tissue
[WRONG] It increases the weight of the heart and abdomen on the lungs

# Question 2
What are major considerations for prone positioning

[RIGHT] Lubricate and tape the eyes closed
[WRONG] Ensure IV tubing is shortened to reduce obstacles in patient care
[WRONG] CPR cannot be performed on these patients
[WRONG] Skin breakdown is less of a risk due to changes in weight distribution

# Nursing Care of the Mechanically Ventilated Patient

### Assessment of patient
* Signs and symptoms of inadequate ventilation or oxygenation --> monitor minute volume, tidal volume, ABG, SpO2
* Signs and symptoms of possible pneumothorax and progression to tension pneumothorax --> caution with high PEEP, monitor lung sounds, watch for mediastinal shift

### Patient Care: Comfort and Communication
* Remove airway secretions- both oral and endotracheal
* Provide different ways to communicate (communication board, yes/no questions)
* Remove accumulated water from tubing/ensure that it drains away from the patient's airway
* Comfort measures: assist with positioning, turn q2 hours, range of motion exercises, reduce pressure on bony prominences, oral care

### Safety
* Patients are often restrained when mechanically ventilated: ensure physician orders are per facility policy, monitor skin integrity under and around restraints, ensure patient cannot reach the ETT or ventilator circuitry but also that restraints are not excessively tight or restrictive.
* Monitor for agitation and resltessness due to restraints and/or the discomfort of mechanical ventilation
* Monitor and titrate continuous sedation to facilitate patient comfort and increase compliance with the ventilator. Do not oversedate- ensure physician orders indicate a clear goal sedation score.
* Educate patient and family members about importance of the mechanical ventilator and ETT.

### Clinical Indications for Suctioning
* Do not suction routinely- should have a clear indication to suction. This is stressful for the patient.
Indications:
* Audible secretions
* Coughing
* Respiratory distress/ hypoxia due to secretions
* Assess and improve airway patency

### Technique
* Sterile technique: use in-line suction that is part of the ventilator set up- this should be constantly connected to suction tubing with wall suction on. Compressing the thumb control button activates suctioning.
* Diameter of suction tubing should be no more than half the diameter of the ETT/tracheostomy
* Ensure wall suction is appropriately set up in the patient's room
* Ensure that suctioning is indicated by assessment
* Preoxygenate patient with "O2 Breath" or FiO2 100% x2mn, inform the patient that suctioning will occur
* Secure ETT/tracheostomy with non-dominant hand
* Quickly but gently advance in-line suction catheter down the ETT/tracheostomy with dominant hand until resistance is met (patient may cough)- Do not compress suction button during catheter insertion
* Compress the thumb control button to activate suction and simultaneously pull the catheter out of the ETT/tracheostomy- this should take no longer than 10-15 seconds
* Limit suctioning time per attempt
* Once suctioning complete, ensure suction catheter tip is out of the ETT/tracheostomy. It will remain in its sterile catheter sheath.

### Nutrition --> to me this goes under complications-- or the nutrition section from the prior page goes here

Malnourishment may cause:
* Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Muscle atrophy
* Respiratory infection
* Decreased surfactant production
* Slowed healing of damaged tissues
* Lower serum albumin levels

#### Overfeeding
* Problems with COPD and other patients unable to clear CO2
* Increased risk for aspiration
* Feeding with high carbohydrate tube feedings or parenteral nutrition increases the CO2 load
* Use of lipids to replace some of the caloric needs can reduce carbohydrate load

# Question 1
Malnourishment may cause:

[RIGHT] Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, decreased surfactant production
[WRONG] Increased response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, decreased surfactant production
[WRONG] Increased response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased surfactant production 
[WRONG] Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased surfactant production

# Question 2
When is suctioning clinically indicated for mechanically ventilated patients?

[WRONG] Every 2 hours
[WRONG] Hypotension
[RIGHT] Coughing or respiratory distress

# Question 3
Which of the following describes appropriate suctioning technique?

[WRONG] Activate suctioning while advancing the in-line suction catheter
[WRONG] Ensure multiple suction attempts are conducted each time
[RIGHT] Limit suction time to 10-15 seconds

# Question 4
Use of lipids to replace caloric needs can reduce what?

[WRONG] Blood glucose
[WRONG] Protein
[RIGHT] Carbohydrate load

# Question 5
Which of the following is a risk of long-term 100% oxygen?

[RIGHT] Oxygen toxicity
[WRONG] Cerebral edema
[WRONG] Cyanosis
[WRONG] Hypercapnia

# Question 6
Identify one way to decrease the complications associated with sterile suctioning:

[WRONG] Use only 50% oxygen before and after suctioning
[WRONG] Remove the sterile suction set up each time a patient is suctioned
[WRONG] Do not used a closed suction system
[RIGHT] Only suction when patient assessment indicates a need

# Question 7
Identify one way to provide controlled ventilation for a patient who is consistently agitated?

[WRONG] Restrain the patient
[RIGHT] Administer continuous sedation
[WRONG] Tell the patient to be calm
[WRONG] Have a nursing assistant sit with the patient throughout the shift

# Question 8 ---> this was not taught in this module- I think it needs to be deleted
Which of the following indicates 90% blockade on the Train-of-Four method of testing level of neuromuscular blockade?

[RIGHT] One twitch
[WRONG] Two twitches
[WRONG] Three twitches
[WRONG] Four twitches

# Question 9 --> this question goes in the prior page- this content wasn't taught in this module
If your patient accidentally extubated himself and is now having respiratory distress, what is the first thing you should do?

[WRONG] Try to reinsert the endotracheal tube
[RIGHT] Manually ventilate the patient with a manual resuscitation bag
[WRONG] Document the pulse oximetry
[WRONG] Obtain an ABG

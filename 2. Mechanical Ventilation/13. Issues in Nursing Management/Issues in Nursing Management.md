# Issues in Nursing Management

### Assessment of patient
* Signs and symptoms of inadequate ventilation or oxygenation
* Signs and symptoms of possible pneumothorax and progression to tension pneumothorax

### Helping patient cope
* Remove airway secretions
* Provide different ways to communicate
* Remove accumulated water from tubing
* Comfort measures
* Sedation

### Clinical Indications for Suctioning
* Audible airway noises
* Coughing
* Respiratory distress
* Assess and improve airway patency

### Technique
* Sterile technique
* Suction catheter size and pressure
* Preoxygenated with a high FiO2
* Hyperventilation prior to suctioning
* Do not suction during cath insertion
* Limit suctioning time per attempt
* Saline instillation

### Nutrition

Malnourishment may cause:
* Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
* Muscle atrophy
* Respiratory infection
* Decreased surfactant production
* Slowed healing of damaged tissues
* Lower serum albumin levels

#### Overfeeding
* Problems with COPD and other patients unable to clear CO2
* Feeding with high carbohydrate tube feedings or parenteral nutrition increases the CO2 load
* Use of lipids to replace some of the caloric needs can reduce carbohydrate load

# Question 1
Malnourishment may cause:

[RIGHT] Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, decreased surfactant production
[WRONG] Increased response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, decreased surfactant production
[WRONG] Increased response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased surfactant production 
[WRONG] Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased surfactant production

# Question 2
When is suctioning clinically indicated for vented patients?

[WRONG] Lack of airway noises
[WRONG] Hypotension
[RIGHT] Coughing or respiratory distress

# Question 3
Which of the following demonstrates proper technique for ventilator use?

[WRONG] Use the highest pressure possible
[WRONG] Avoid limiting suctioning time per attempt
[RIGHT] Do not suction during cath insertion

# Question 4
Use of lipids to replace caloric needs can reduce what?

[WRONG] Blood glucose
[WRONG] Protein
[RIGHT] Carbohydrate load

# Question 5
Which of the following is a risk of long-term 100% oxygen?

[RIGHT] Oxygen toxicity
[WRONG] Cerebral edema
[WRONG] Cyanosis
[WRONG] Hypercapnia

# Question 6
Identify one way to decrease the complications associated with sterile suctioning:

[WRONG] Use only 50% oxygen before and after suctioning
[WRONG] Suction routinely every hour
[WRONG] Do not used a closed suction system
[RIGHT] Do not routinely instill saline prior to suctioning

# Question 7
Identify one way to provide controlled ventilation for a patient who is consistently agitated?

[WRONG] Restrain the patient
[RIGHT] Administer continuous sedation and neuromuscular blockade
[WRONG] Tell the patient to be calm
[WRONG] Have a nursing assistant sit with the patient throughout the shift

# Question 8
Which of the following indicates 90% blockade on the Train-of-Four method of testing level of neuromuscular blockade?

[RIGHT] One twitch
[WRONG] Two twitches
[WRONG] Three twitches
[WRONG] Four twitches

# Question 9
If your patient accidentally extubated himself and is now having respiratory distress, what is the first thing you should do?

[WRONG] Try to reinsert the endotracheal tube
[RIGHT] Manually ventilate the patient with a manual resuscitation bag
[WRONG] Document the pulse oximetry
[WRONG] Obtain an ABG

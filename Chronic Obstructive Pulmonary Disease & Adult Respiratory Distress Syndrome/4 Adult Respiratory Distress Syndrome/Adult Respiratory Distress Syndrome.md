# Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
* Severe form of respiratory failure that Occurs in previously healthy individuals
* Characterized by lung edema, formation of hyaline membranes, microatelectasis, alveolar hemorrhage causing dyspnea  and hypoxia

# Etiology
* Shock of any etiology
* Infectious cause (sepsis)
* Micro emboli- fat or air embolism
* Liquid aspiration
* Inhaled toxins – smoke, toxic agents
* Metabolic disorders
* Trauma
* Eclampsia
* Oxygen toxicity
* Banked blood- large amounts
* Overhydration
* Drug overdose – particularly heroin
* Cardiopulmonary bypass

# Pathogenesis
* Diffuse damage to that alveolar-capillary membrane
* Increased permeability and leakage of fluid at the alveolar-capillary membrane
* Damage to type II pneumocytes
* Interstitial and alveolar edema results in interference with gas exchange and hypoxemia. Reduced FRC, Intrapulmonary shunting and Decreased compliance.
* Protein exudates destroy surfactant causing alveolar collapse
* Protein exudates from the hyaline membrane causes interstitial fibrosis
* Profound Hypoxemia – exists inspite of high-inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2)

# Clinical Presentation
* Tachypnea
* Increasing dyspnea
* Hyperventilation
* Respiratory distress
* Labored respirations
* Retractions
* Cyanosis
* Restlessness, anxiety

# Diagnostics
### ABG
* Refractory hypoxemia – hallmark of disease refractoy to O2 therapy (PaO2<55 mmHg)
* Hypocapnia – compensatory increase in minute ventilation to maintain PaO2 until patient fatigues
* Respiratory alkalosis secondary to hyperventialtion

### CXR
* Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates

### Pulmonary Function Tests
* PaO2<55 mmHg on FIO2 ..50
* Decreased lung compliance
* Reduced functional residual capacity
* Right to left shunt
* PaO2/FIO2 ratio = PaO2/FIO2
* Normal ratio – 300 to 400
* Acute lung injury – 200 to 300
* ARDS - <200

# Management

### Maintaining patent airway
* Restoration of arterial oxygen levels
 * Lowest FIO2 to produce oxygen saturation
 * Maintain PaO2 level within acceptable range

### Mechanical Ventilation
* Set RR and TV to meet ventilation requirements
* Lower tidal volumes- decreases risk of barotrauma

### Use of PEEP
* Improves oxygenation by re-expanding alveoli
* Decrease shunting by opening non-ventilatory lung units
* Use lowest level of PEEP
* High PEEP may decrease cardiac output and increase barotrauma

### Endotrachael tubes

### Tracheostomy tube

### Cardiovascular Support
* Fluid management
* Inotropic/vasoactive support
* Normalize Hgb
* Appropriate use of hemodynamic monitoring
* Sedation/paralysis/pain management
* Narcotic – pain management
* Benzodiazepines – sedation, amnesia and muscle relaxants
* Neuromuscular blocking agents (paralytic agents)

### Pharmacological Support
* Antibiotics
* Antipyretics – avoid cooling blankets which may cause shivering

### Nutritional Support

\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Emphysema \
\
## Pathology\
* Airway obstruction\
* Hyperinflation\
* Loss of lung elastic recoil\
* Destruction of the alveolar-capillary\
    interface\

## CXR of patient with Emphysema\

\
\
## Emphysema (Pink puffer)\
* Progressive constant dyspnea\
* Onset after 50 years of age\
* Mild sputum \'96 clear\
* Thin, wasted, AP diameter increased\
* BARREL chest\
* Percussion \'96 hyper resonant\
* HCT normal\
* CXR \'96 bullae, blebs\
* Hyperinflation\
* Lung capacity increased\
* Pursed lip breathing\
\
\
## Emphysema\
* Decreased ventilation\
* Decrease pulmonary diffusion surface\
* Changes move prominent during expiration\
* Air trapping\
* Tissue lose elasticity\
* Alveolar septum is destroyed\
* mucus-secreting glands and cells\
* Increased number of Submucosal edema\
* Narrowing of bronchial lumen\
* Thickening of bronchial/bronchiolar walls\
* Increased deadspace\
* Dilation of distal airways\
\
# Chronic Bronchitis \
\
## Pathology \
* Thickened bronchial walls\
* Hyperplasia and hypertrophied mucous glands\
* Mucosal inflammation in the bronchial wall, large central airways and small airways\
\
## Chronic Bronchitis (Blue Bloater)\
* Intermittent mild/moderate dyspnea\
* Onset after 35 years of age\
* Copious sputum production \'96 purulent\
* Stocky, obese, AP diameter-normal\
* Percussion \'96 normal\
* HCT increased\
* Hypercapnea\
* Hypoxemia\
* Smoker hack\
* Pulmonary HTN\
* Hepatomegaly\
\
\
## Chronic Bronchitis (Blue Bloater)\
* Cough and sputum production for 3 months/year\
* Overinflation of alveoli\
* Abnormal distribution of ventilation\
* Narrowing of airways due to thickening of bronchial walls\
* Development of mucus plugs\
* Inflammatory changes in bronchial and bronchiolar walls\
* Decrease number of cilia\
* Increase in number and size of mucus-secreting glands and bronchial cells\
\
## Airway in Chronic Bronchitis\
![](assets/airway_in_chronic_bronchitis.png)\
\
## Risk Factors\
* Cigarette smoking\
* Chronic respiratory infections\
* Occupational/environmental exposure \'96 dust,chemical, fumes\
* Allergies and disease\
* A-protease inhibitor deficiency\
\
COPD gradually worsens. HOWEVER, early detection, treatment and modification of risk factors can alter the disease course.\
\
# Infection and Pulmonary Hypertension \
\
## Infection\
The most common cause of death \
\
## Pulmonary Hypertension \
\
May result in signs and symptoms of right heart failure \
* Dyspnea\
* Angina at rest\
* Syncope\
* Cyanosis\
* Peripheral edema\
* Hepatomegaly\
* Renal dysfunction\

# Modes of Ventilation

### Control Mandatory Ventilation (CMV)
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate
* Patient cannot take any spontaneous breaths

#### Disadvantages
* No spontaneous breathing
* Patient cannot adjust to changes in demands
* Lack of control – can cause discomfort/anxiety
* May lead to hyperventilation
* Requires sedation/paralysis

### A/C – Assist Control
* Each breath is either “Assisted” or “Controlled”
* Preset tidal volume and respiratory rate
* Controlled breaths are determined by the rate or frequency (“f”) that is set.
* Assisted breaths that are triggered by the patient (spontaneous) are supported with the pre-set tidal volume

#### Advantages
* Patient is guaranteed a set number of breaths
* Patient sets own breath interval and can take spontaneous breaths
* Resting of respiratory muscles

#### Disadvantages
* May decrease cardiac output
* Respiratory alkalosis (if patient takes too many spontaneous breaths, all of those are supported with the pre-set tidal volume)

### Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
* Combines spontaneous breathing with mechanical ventilatory support
* Preset respiratory rate and tidal volume
* If patient takes any breaths above the pre-set rate, those breaths are not supported by the pre-set tidal volume (patient effort determines tidal volume)

#### Advantages
* Synchronized respirations – less stacking and air trapping
* Allows exercise of respiratory muscles
* Possible less respiratory alkalosis in anxious patient (spontaneous breaths are not supported by pre-set tidal volume)

### Disadvantages
* Limited capacity to meet increasing ventilatory demands (depending on set respiratory rate)
* Resp acidosis may occur if insufficient ventilation
* Fatigue of respiratory muscles can occur due to increased work of breathing placed on the patient

### Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV)
* Pressure-assisted form of mechanical ventilation
* Augments patient’s own spontaneous efforts- patient triggers all breaths, no pre-set respiratory rate

#### Advantages
* Patient controls inspiratory timing
* Gas flow can be changed to increase comfort
* Work of breathing can be relieved or progressively allowed
* Used in weaning
* Support ventilation along with SIMV (a set PS can be added on to spontaneous breaths to provide support)

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volumes can decrease – in the case of decreased lung compliance
* Patient must have respiratory drive- no breaths will be delivered unless the patient triggers them
* Not for full support of unstable patients
* Back-up rate is not guaranteed if used alone

### Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV)
* Pre-set amount of pressure (PS) delivere with a set number of breaths (RR)
* If patient takes spontaneous breaths above the pre-set RR, these breaths are also supported by the present PS
* Mechanical inspiratory phase limited to prevent lung trauma

#### Advantage
* More natural feeling/comfortable for the patient

#### Disadvantages
* Tidal volume is not guaranteed
* Hypoventilation risk in patients with low lung compliance

### Pressure Controlled Inverse-Ratio Ventilation (PC-IRV)
* Same as PCV, except in addition, the inspiratory phase is longer than expiratory phase providing an I:E ratio from 2:1 to 4:1 (instead of normal I:E ratio of 1:2)

#### Advantage
* Improved arterial oxygenation and ventilation with lower peak pressure

#### Disadvantages
* Limited use – requires technical support and experience
* Can require more sedation and patient may need neuromuscular paralysis

# Adjuncts to Mechanical Ventilation--> I don't know why this is titled this way? PEEP is not an adjunct, it's a ventilator setting (See my comments re ventilator settings in previous module)

### Positive-End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
* Airway pressure is maintained at end of expiration
* Increases functional residual capacity (FRC) thus improving lung volume and promoting alveolar recruitment
* Used for patients with refractory hypoxemia and bilateral lung disease

#### Complications of Positive Pressure Ventilation
* Reduced cardiac output due to increased intrathoracic pressure
* May increase intracerebral pressure
* Increase risk for barotrauma
* Increase risk for pneumothorax

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
* Provides continuous positive pressure either invasively (eg. through the endotracheal tube) or noninvasively (eg. through tightly-fitting mask)
* Settings: PEEP and FiO2
* Patient must trigger all breaths- no pre-set respiratory rate
* No preset tidal volume
* Noninvasive CPAP used most often with patients as a last effort before intubation
* Also used as weaning mode (because it requires more work from the patient)
* Commonly used as treatment for sleep apnea

PEEP is used when the patient is receiving a mechanical breath.
CPAP is used when the patient is breathing spontaneously.

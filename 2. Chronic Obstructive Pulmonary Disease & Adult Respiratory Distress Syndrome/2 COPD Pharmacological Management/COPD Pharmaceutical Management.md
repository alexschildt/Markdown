* Option C: Infectious agents are part of the risk factors for emphysema but it is not the main factor

# Definition
* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a condition of chronic dyspnea with expiratory airflow limitation that does not significantly fluctuate
* COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States
* It is also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)
* The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease as “a preventable and treatable disease with some significant extrapulmonary effects that may contribute to the severity in individual patients”
* There are two classifications of COPD: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. These two types of COPD can have overlapping signs and symptoms
* The primary cause of the obstruction may vary; examples include airway inflammation that blocks airflow, mucous secretion that blocks airways, alveolar wall destruction, and narrowed airway lumina

### Chronic Bronchitis clinical diagnosis
A disease of the airways and is defined as the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of 2 consecutive years
* Patients with Chronic Bronchitis, often referred to as "Blue Bloaters," are large, edematous persons with cyanosis and relatively little dyspnea.

### Emphysema pathological diagnosis
An abnormal distention of airspaces beyond the terminal bronchioles and destruction of the walls of the alveoli
* Patients with Emphysema, often referred to as "Pink Puffers," are thin, cachetic persons with marked shortness of breath—the decreased lung compliance leads to increased work of breathing and dyspnea.

# Management

# Question
Goals to achieve in management of patients with COPD include all of the following, EXCEPT:
[WRONG] Achievement of airway clearance
[WRONG] Improvement in breathing pattern
[WRONG] Independence in self-care activities
[RIGHT] Continuation of existing lifestyle

* The patient should be made aware of changes to existing habits which are causing COPD (e.g. smoking, inadequate nutrition)

### Goals to achieve include:
* Improvement in gas exchange
* Achievement of airway clearance
* Improvement in breathing pattern
* Independence in self-care activities
* Improvement in activity intolerance
* Ventilation/oxygenation adequate to meet self-care needs
* Nutritional intake meeting caloric needs
* Infection treated/prevented
* Disease process/prognosis and therapeutic regimen understood
* Plan in place to meet needs after discharge

### Nursing priorities
* Maintain airway patency
* Assist with measures to facilitate gas exchange
* Enhance nutritional intake
* Prevent complications, slow progression of condition
* Provide information about disease process/prognosis and treatment regimen

### Nursing Care Plan interventions
* Patient and family teaching is an important nursing intervention to enhance self-management in patients with any chronic pulmonary disorder

To achieve airway clearance:
* The nurse must appropriately administer bronchodilators and corticosteroids and become alert for potential side effects.
Direct or controlled coughing
* The nurse instructs the patient in direct or controlled coughing, which is more effective and reduces fatigue associated with undirected forceful coughing

To improve breathing pattern:
* Inspiratory muscle training: This may help improve the breathing pattern
* Diaphragmatic breathing: Diaphragmatic breathing reduces respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and sometimes helps expel as much air as possible during expiration
* Pursed lip breathing: Pursed lip breathing helps slow expiration, prevents collapse of small airways, and control the rate and depth of respiration

To improve activity intolerance:
* Manage daily activities: Daily activities must be paced throughout the day and support devices can be also used to decrease energy expenditure
* Exercise training: Exercise training can help strengthen muscles of the upper and lower extremities and improve exercise tolerance and endurance
* Walking aids: Use of walking aids may be recommended to improve activity levels and ambulation

To monitor and manage potential complications:
* Monitor cognitive changes: The nurse should monitor for cognitive changes such as personality and behavior changes and memory impairment
* Monitor pulse oximetry values: Pulse oximetry values are used to assess the patient’s need for oxygen and administer supplemental oxygen as prescribed
* Prevent infection: The nurse should encourage the patient to be immunized against influenza and S. pneumonia because the patient is prone to respiratory infection

Evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions outlined in the Nursing Care Plan can be achieved by the Nurse verifying that the patient:
* Identifies hazards of cigarette smoking
* Identifies resources for smoking cessation
* Enrolls in smoking cessation program
* Minimizes or eliminates exposures
* Verbalizes the need for fluids
* Is free of infection
* Practices breathing techniques
* Performs activities with less shortness of breath

### Discharge and Home Care Guidelines

It is important for the nurse to assess the knowledge of patient and family members about self-care and the therapeutic regimen.

* Setting goals: If the COPD is mild, the objectives of the treatment are to increase exercise tolerance and prevent further loss of pulmonary function, while if COPD is severe, these objectives are to preserve current pulmonary function and relieve symptoms as much as possible

* Temperature control: The nurse should instruct the patient to avoid extremes of heat and cold because heat increases the temperature and thereby raising oxygen requirements and high altitudes increase hypoxemia

* Activity moderation: The patient should adapt a lifestyle of moderate activity and should avoid emotional disturbances and stressful situations that might trigger a coughing episode

* Breathing retraining: The home care nurse must provide the education and breathing retraining necessary to optimize the patient’s functional status

### Documentation Guidelines

Documentation is an essential part of the patient’s chart because the interventions and medications given and done are reflected on this part.

* Document assessment findings including respiratory rate, character of breath sounds; frequency, amount and appearance of secretions laboratory findings and mentation level
* Document conditions that interfere with oxygen supply
* Document plan of care and specific interventions
* Document liters of supplemental oxygen
* Document client’s responses to treatment, teaching, and actions performed
* Document teaching plan
* Document modifications to plan of care
* Document attainment or progress towards goals

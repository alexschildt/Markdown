# Respiratory failure 

Gas exchange is so severely impaired that arterial hypercapnea or hypoxemia occurs
* Hypoxemia - PaO2 <50
* Hypercapnea - PaCO2>50. Directly linked to gas exchange insufficiencies

### PaCO2 > 50
* Acute. PaCO2 rises rapidly producing an immediate threat to life by an abnormal pH
* Chronic. Arterial pH is close to normal regardless of paCO2

### Alveolar Hypoventilation
* Unable to remove all the CO2 produced by cellular metabolism
* CO2 accumulates in the blood
* PaCO2 rises and PaO2 falls

# Question 1
What indicates arterial hypercapnea and hypoxemia?

[RIGHT] PaO2 < 50 indicates Hypoxemia, PaO2 > 50 indicates Hypercapnea
[WRONG] PaO2 < 50 indicates Hypercapnea, PaO2 > 50 indicates Hypoxemia

# Question 2
Which of the following indicates chronic ventilatory failure?

[RIGHT] Arterial pH is close to normal regardless of PaCO2
[WRONG] PaCO2 rises rapidly, producing an abnormal pH threat
[WRONG] Arterial pH is abnormal as a result of high PaCO2

# Question 3
What causes alevolar hypoventilation? 

[RIGHT] CO2 accumulates in the blood, PaCO2 rises and PaO2 falls
[WRONG] O2 accumulates in the blood, PaCO2 falls and PaO2 rises

# Clinical categories and determinants of Acute Respiratory Failure

### Clinical category 
Failure of Alveolar ventilation

### Clinical Determinants
*  Increase PaCO2
*  Decrease pH
*  Decrease PaO2

### Clinical Category 
Failure of arterial blood oxygenation
* Hypoxemia
* Inadequate CaO2

### Clinical Determinants
* Decrease PaO2
* Decrease SaO2

### Clinical Category
* Failure of Tissue Oxygenation
* Inadequate systemic O2 delivery
* Inadequate tissue O2 extraction

### Clinical Determinants
* Decrease CaO2
* Decrease VO2

# Question 4
What are the clinical determinants of failure of alveolar ventilation?

[RIGHT]  Increased PaCO2 , decreased pH, decreased PaO2
[WRONG] Decreased PaCO2 , increased pH, increased PaO2
[WRONG] Increased PaCO2 , increased pH, decreased PaO2

# Question 5
What are the clinical determinants of failure of arterial blood oxygenation?

[RIGHT]  Decreased PaCO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Decreased PaO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Decreased PaCO2 , increased SaO2
[WRONG]  Increased PaCO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Increased PaO2 , decreased SaO2
[WRONG]  Decreased PaO2 , increased SaO2

# Question 6
What are the clinical determinants of failure of arterial blood oxygenation?

[RIGHT]  Decreased CaO2 , decreased VO2
[WRONG]  Increased CaO2 , decreased VO2
[WRONG]  Decreased CaO2 , increased VO2
[WRONG]  Increased CaO2 , increased VO2

# Clinical Presentation

### Hypoxemia
Symptoms: Restlessness, agitation, disorientation, confusion, delirium, dyspnea
Physical Findings: Cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, cyanosis, labored breathing tachypnea

### Hypercapnia
Symptoms: Headache, somnolence, dizziness, coma, confusion
Physical Findings: Hypertension, tachycardia, muscle, twitching, diaphoresis, papilledema,miosis

### Acidosis
Symptoms: Coma
Physical Findings: Cardiac arrhythmias

# Diagnostics
* ABG. PaO2 < 50 mmHg, PaCO2 >50mmHg
* CXR

# Management 
* Improve oxygenation and ventilation
* Maintain optimal cardiac output: Fluid or inotropic support or vasoactive support
* Normalize Hgb
* Treat underlying conditions
* Sedation/paralysis/pain management
* Nutritional support
* Positioning

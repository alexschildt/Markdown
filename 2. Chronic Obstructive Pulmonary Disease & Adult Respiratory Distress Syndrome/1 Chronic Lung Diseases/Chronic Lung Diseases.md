# Emphysema 

### Pathology
* Airway obstruction
* Hyperinflation
* Loss of lung elastic recoil
* Destruction of the alveolar-capillar interface

### Alveolus in Emphysema

### Destroyed Lung parenchyma

### CXR of patient with Emphysema

![](assets/CXR.png)

### Emphysema (Pink puffer)
* Progressive constant dyspnea
* Onset after 50 years of age
* Mild sputum – clear
* Thin, wasted, AP diameter increased
* BARREL chest
* Percussion – hyper resonant
* HCT normal
* CXR – bullae, blebs
* Hyperinflation
* Lung capacity increased
* Pursed lip breathing

### Emphysema
* Decreased ventilation
* Decrease pulmonary diffusion surface
* Changes move prominent during expiration
* Air trapping
* Tissue lose elasticity
* Alveolar septum is destroyed
* mucus-secreting glands and cells
* Increased number of Submucosal edema
* Narrowing of bronchial lumen
* Thickening of bronchial/bronchiolar walls
* Increased deadspace
* Dilation of distal airways

# Question 3
Which of the following are all characteristic of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?

[RIGHT] Onset after 50 years of age, AP diameter increased, lung capacity increased, pursed lip breathing
[WRONG] Onset after 50 years of age, AP diameter decreased, lung capacity decreased, pursed lip breathing
[WRONG] Onset after 50 years of age, AP diameter increased, lung capacity decreased, percussion (hyper resonant)
[WRONG] Onset after 50 years of age, AP diameter decreased, lung capacity increased, percussion (hyper resonant)

# Question 4
What condition is characterized by an abnormal permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the bronchioles?

[RIGHT] Emphysema
[WRONG] Chronic bronchitis
[WRONG] Pneumonia

# Question 5
Which of the following is NOT considered a syndrome of COPD?

[RIGHT] Pneumonia
[WRONG] Emphysema
[WRONG] Chronic bronchitis


# Chronic Bronchitis 

### Pathology 
* Thickened bronchial walls
* Hyperplasia and hypertrophied mucous glands
* Mucosal inflammation in the bronchial wall, large central airways and small airways

### Chronic Bronchitis (Blue Bloater)
* Intermittent mild/moderate dyspnea
* Onset after 35 years of age
* Copious sputum production – purulent
* Stocky, obese, AP diameter-normal
* Percussion – normal
* HCT increased
* Hypercapnea
* Hypoxemia
* Smoker hack
* Pulmonary HTN
* Hepatomegaly

### Chronic Bronchitis (Blue Bloater)
* Cough and sputum production for 3 months/year
* Overinflation of alveoli
* Abnormal distribution of ventilation
* Narrowing of airways due to thickening of bronchial walls
* Development of mucus plugs
* Inflammatory changes in bronchial and bronchiolar walls
* Decrease number of cilia
* Increase in number and size of mucus-secreting glands and bronchial cells

### Airway in Chronic Bronchitis
![](assets/airway_in_chronic_bronchitis.png)

### Risk Factors
* Cigarette smoking
* Chronic respiratory infections
* Occupational/environmental exposure – dust,chemical, fumes
* Allergies and disease
* A-protease inhibitor deficiency

COPD gradually worsens. HOWEVER, early detection, treatment and modification of risk factors can alter the disease course.

# Question 6
Chronic bronchitis is characterized by:

[RIGHT] Excessive secretion of bronchial tree mucus
[WRONG] Irritation of the sinus cavities
[WRONG] Permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the bronchiole

# Question 7
What condition is manifested by a productive cough for greater than 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other disease?

[RIGHT] Chronic bronchitis
[WRONG] Acute pneumonia
[WRONG] Pneumothorax

# Infection and Pulmonary Hypertension 

### Infection
The most common cause of death 

### Pulmonary Hypertension 

May result in signs and symptoms of right heart failure 
* Dyspnea
* Angina at rest
* Syncope
* Cyanosis
* Peripheral edema
* Hepatomegaly
* Renal dysfunction

# Question 8
Pulmonary hypertension can result in signs and symptoms of which of the following?

[RIGHT] Right heart failure
[WRONG] Pulmonary embolism
[WRONG] Pleuritis

# Question 9
Which of the following are signs and symptoms of right heart failure?

[RIGHT] Dyspnea, syncope, peripheral edema
[WRONG] Productive cough, fever, elevated white blood count
[WRONG] Hypotension, erythema, palpitations

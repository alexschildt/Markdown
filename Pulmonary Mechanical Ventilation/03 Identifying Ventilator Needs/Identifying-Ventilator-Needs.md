# Indications

### Inability to maintain adequate ventilation

* Ventilation – ability to remove CO2 from lungs
* High PaCO2 – hypoventilation
* Low PaCO2 - hyperventilation

### Inability to maintain adequated oxygenation

* Hypercarbia and hypoxemia frequently occur together
* Hypoxemia with low to normal CO2
* PaO2 cannot be maintained >50 mmHg by increasing FiO2

### Work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

* Ventilation is inefficient and exhausting
* Increased RR due to stiff compliance
* Decreased vital capacity

Isolate and protect the airway.

Relieve airway obstruction.

Facilitate suctioning of the tracheobronchial tree.

# Introductory Note
Guard against incorrect ventilator settings.
Ventilator disconnect from patient is a common problem.

# High pressure alarm
* Patient needs suctioning
* Patient is biting the tube
* Tracheal tube has become misplaced
* Compliance is decreased
* Barotrauma

# Not receiving set tidal volume
* Cuff leak/insufficient air in cuff
 * ALARM: low volume air
 * RX: Ventilate patient until cause is identified
* Airway resistance. Compliance
 * ALARM: upper airway pressure alarm**
 * RX: Ventilate patient until cause is identified**

# NO tidal volume
* Patient disconnect from ventilator
* Large cuff leak
* Tube disconnect
* ALARM: low volume alarm
* RX: Reconnect tubing, attempt to ambu until reintubation

# Increased Airway Pressure
* Secretions, mucous plug, biting on the tube
* Decreased compliance – pneumothorax, atelectasis
* ETT slipped into RIGHT mainstem bronchus
* Increased resistance – high diaphragm
* ALARM: airway pressure alarm
* RX: Suctioning, bite plate
 * Assess breath sounds for ET placement
 * Position patient
 * Sedation

# Decreased or Loss of Volume
* Leak in ventilator system
* Cuff leak
* Humidifier leak
* RX: Correct leak source

# Respiratory Alkalosis
* CO2<35 pH >7.45
* Increased respiratory rate
* Restlessness, pain, anxiety
* Rate set up too high
* Tidal volume set too high
* RX: Sedation
 * Adjust rate, tidal volume

# Respiratory Acidosis
* CO2>45 pH <7.35
* RX: Increase tidal volume
 * Adjust rate, tidal volume

# Thick Secretions
* Inadequate hydration
* Insufficient humidification
* Infection, fever
* RX: Water in humidifier
 * Monitor fluid status

# High PaO2
* Delivering too high FiO2
* Improved clinical status

# Low PaO2
* VQ mismatch
* Pulmonary embolus
* Pulmonary edema
* RX: Monitor ABG and adjust FiO2 accordingly
 * PEEP

# Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased venous return
* Relief of work effort
* PEEP
* Inadequate fluid volume status

Always assess patient first, then check the ventilator tubing while ambuing.

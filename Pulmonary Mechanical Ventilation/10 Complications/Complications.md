# Complications of Mechanical Ventilation

## Infection
* Normal filtering system (nose) is bypassed
* Breaks in aseptic technique
* Debilitated patients

## Airway Obstruction
* Inadequate humidification causing thickened mucus
* Increased secretions with inadequate pulmonary toiletry
* Patient biting tube

## Atelectasis
* Bedrest
* Inadequate tidal volume
* Absent intermittent deep lung infections

## Oxygen Toxicity
* Prolonged high oxygen levels – FiO2 0.7-1.0
* Impaired surfactant activity

## Gastrointestinal Bleeding
* Stress
* Gastric hypersecretion of acid
* Lack of antacid therapy

## Pneumothorax
* Positive pressure causing a break in the integrity of the visceral pleura

## Hypotension
* Normal negative pressure becomes positive – decreases venous return
* Decreased pulmonary blood flow due to increased intrathoracic pressure compressing capillaries
* Compression of heart between the lungs - decreasing stroke volume

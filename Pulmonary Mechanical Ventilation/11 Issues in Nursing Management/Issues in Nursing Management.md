# Issues in Nursing Management

## Assessment of patient
* Signs and symptoms of inadequate ventilation or oxygenation
* Signs and symptoms of possible pneumothorax and progression to tension pneumothorax

## Helping patient cope
* Remove airway secretions
* Provide different ways to communicate
* Remove accumulated water from tubing
* Comfort measures
* Sedation

## Clinical Indications for Suctioning
* Audible airway noises
* Coughing
* Respiratory distress
* Assess and improve airway patency

## Technique
* Sterile technique
* Suction catheter size and pressure
* Preoxygenated with a high FiO2
* Hyperventilation prior to suctioning
* Do not suction during cath insertion
* Limit suctioning time per attempt
* Saline instillation

## Nutrition

### Malnourishment may cause
* Reduced response to hypoxia and hypercabnia
* Muscle atrophy
* Respiratory infection
* Decreased surfactant production
* Slowed healing of damaged tissues
* Lower serum albumin levels

### Overfeeding
* Problems with COPD and other patients unable to clear CO2
* Feeding with high carbohydrate tube feedings or parenteral nutrition increases the CO2 load
* Use of lipids to replace some of the caloric needs can reduce carbohydrate load
